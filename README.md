### Rule Configuration
Rules are a simple way to manage which items you can store in a specific warehouse.
In order to create a rule for your warehouse, you have to create a Common Event in the database called "PHWarehouse".
Inside of that Common Event, you will create some comments in order to populate the rules for warehouses.
These comments must have the following format:

``{Title of the Rule}``    
``[commands]``

The ``[commands]`` you can specify are as follow:

* ``item: 1`` (Just allow the storage of the item with id 1)
* ``item: 1, 2, 3, 4`` (Allows the storage of items with id 1, 2, 3 and 4)
* ``item: no`` (Does not allow the storage of items)
* ``item-n: 1`` (Allows the storage of any item except the one with id 1)
* (If you don't specify the command "item" in the rule, all items will be allowed to be stored)

* ``weapon: 1`` (Just allow the storage of the weapon with id 1)
* ``weapon: 1, 2, 3, 4`` (Allows the storage of weapons with id 1, 2, 3 and 4)
* ``weapon: no`` (Does not allow the storage of weapons)
* ``weapon-n: 1`` (Allows the storage of any weapon except the one with id 1)
* (If you don't specify the command "weapon" in the rule, all weapons will be allowed to be stored)

* ``armor: 1`` (Just allow the storage of the armor with id 1)
* ``armor: 1, 2, 3, 4`` (Allows the storage of armors with id 1, 2, 3 and 4)
* ``armor: no`` (Does not allow the storage of armors)
* ``armor-n: 1`` (Allows the storage of any armor except the one with id 1)
* (If you don't specify the command "armor" in the rule, all armors will be allowed to be stored)

* ``keyItem: 1`` (Just allow the storage of the key item with id 1)
* ``keyItem: 1, 2, 3, 4`` (Allows the storage of key items with id 1, 2, 3 and 4)
* ``keyItem: no`` (Does not allow the storage of key items)
